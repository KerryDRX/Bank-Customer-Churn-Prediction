<h1 align="center"> Bank Customer Churn Prediction </h1>
This project attempts to recognize bank customers who are likely to churn in the future. Four supervised machine learning models (Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and XGBoost) are implemented to predict churns. The factors that influence user retention the most will also be identified using feature importance and SHAP values.

The dataset is retrieved from [Kaggle (Predicting Churn for Bank Customers)]((https://www.kaggle.com/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers)).
